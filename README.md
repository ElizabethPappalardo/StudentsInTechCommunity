# Students In Tech Community

Welcome to the Student in Tech Community. A group for likeminded students to connect and learn about how to leverage technology in their early careers or pursue a career in the tech industry. We aim to gather for regular events for networking, workshopping and meeting industry leaders to empower you build your confidence for landing your dream job.

This group is led by [Elizabeth Pappalardo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethpappalardo/), Community Manager from Microsoft. Elizabeth is passionate about building a community for students to learn, grow and network.
